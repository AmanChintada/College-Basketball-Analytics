An in-depth analysis of 'winning' characteristics of NCAA Men's Basketball teams from 2013 - 2019. 
Data was taken from sourced from Kaggle. All credit for the csv used in this project goes to Andrew Sundberg. A link to the original csv can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewsundberg/college-basketball-dataset?select=cbb21.csv

Basketball is a game with an astounding number of variables that can mean the difference between a win and a loss. In very simple terms, some of the best basketball teams have a well-balanced offense and defense. This means that their offensive statistics (indicating that they can score a lot of points) are high and their defensive statistics are low (indicating that don’t allow too many points). Based on these statistics we can start to evaluate teams based on how ‘good’ they are on offense and defense.
